must not have any buffered messages at the time this function is

must not drop messages).

WRITER-COUNT writer threads are created to write to the channel.

READER-COUNT reader threads are created to read from the channel.

The CHANNEL is tested under reader-contention, writer-contention, and
natural conditions.  Under the reader-contention condition, writer
threads will intentionally become slow in order to induce multiple
readers contending for CHANNEL; the buffer of CHANNEL (if any) should
become empty.  Under the writer-contention condition, reader threads
will intentionally become slow in order to induce multiple writer
threads contending for CHANNEL; the buffer of CHANNEL (if any) should
become full (or grow indefinately if unbounded).  Under the natural
condition, no thread will intentionally slow down to induce contention
on the other side.  The condition which is in effect cycles once every
3 seconds; therefore, a high enough MESSAGE-COUNT should be given so
that this function takes at least ~10 seconds to run."
